# zinedown

zinedown is an RMarkdown template for making zines.
Zines are short booklets, usually printed in low volumes.
They often represent by do-it-yourself (DIY) culture.

## Installation

You can install zinedown with:

```r
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/zinedown")
```
# How does it work?

If you create a new RMarkdown document in RStudio after installing the package, you should see 'zine' as a template option.
The pdf output of this template looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
i1 = pdftools::pdf_render_page(pdf = "inst/rmarkdown/templates/zine/skeleton/_book/_main.pdf", page = 1)
i2 = pdftools::pdf_render_page(pdf = "inst/rmarkdown/templates/zine/skeleton/_book/_main.pdf", page = 2)
png::writePNG(i2, "i2.png")
knitr::include_graphics(c("i1.png", "i2.png"))
```
