# zinedown

zinedown is an RMarkdown template for making zines. Zines are short
booklets, usually printed in low volumes. They often represent by
do-it-yourself (DIY) culture.

## Installation

You can install zinedown with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/zinedown")
```

# How does it work?

If you create a new RMarkdown document in RStudio after installing the
package, you should see ‘zine’ as a template option. The pdf output of
this template looks like this:
