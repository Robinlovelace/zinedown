# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is the contents of your zine.

# What is a zine?

There is no authoritative definition of zines because, by nature, they are anti-authority [@stoddart_zines_2013]:

> Zines are tricky to define.
The modern zine bears little resemblance to its cousin, the fanzine..
There are many kinds of zines in many sizes.
Today’s zine is a product of the current technological environment.
A zine may be a few sheets of paper [or] a zine also may be a seventy-five page newsprint book-let produced in a quantity of two thousand and printed by a
small press at the zinester’s (a zine’s editor) expense.
